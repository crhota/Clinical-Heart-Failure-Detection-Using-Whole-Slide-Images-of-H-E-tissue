# Clinical-Heart-Failure-Detection-Using-Whole-Slide-Images-of-H-E-tissue
This project implements code for detecting clinical heart failure from whole slide images of H&E tissue using CNN in Python.

**Aim of the Project**
Automated detection of clinical heart failure from Whole-Slide Images of H&E tissue using a Convolutional Neural Network. Determine whether the given histopathology patch image (250x250x3) is normal or has a heart failure (binary classification).
